Project is on Evaluation System(Checking paper online)
Build in C# as frontend(Visual Studio 2015) and SQL Server 2008 as backend
Their is two side of System
1)Server
2)Client

Both can be viewed from visual studio 2015
for Server
Visual Studio->Open->Project->Locate the SLN file (i.e. Server.sln )
for Client
Visual Studio->Open->Project->Locate the SLN file (i.e. Client.sln )

Database is also included into this, namely Chor.MDF and Chor.LDF
This both have to be attached to SQL server 2008
Open Sql server(Run as Administrator)-> Log into your sqlsever
Expand the node on left side
Right click on Database and select Attach
Click on Add button and browse the location of Chor.mdf file(You will see only MDF file,LDF will be automatically added)
Click ok and That's it


NOTE:
You have to change the Connection String on both Server as well as client
you have to find this line into all pages of project
SQLConnection con=new SQLConnection("Data source=ACER\\SQLEXPRESS;Initial Catalog=Chor;Integrated Security=true")
Replace ACER\\SQLEXPRESS with you SQLSERVER[you can find this by open sql server 2008 and when you prompt to select windows or sql authentication you will find Textbox which have you sqlserver name]
thats its
enjoy
